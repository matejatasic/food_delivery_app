Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: I thought that the running time would increase
by the number of times the current simulation is bigger than the previous(in this case by 10), but as the number of simulations increased
the running time was getting much bigger than expected

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: Probably 100000 because it is a lot of simulations and on the
other hand running time is still lower than a second, so that seems like a good tradeof between running time and the precision of predictions
